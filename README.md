# ClaheThresholding_opencv
CLAHE works on small areas of an image called tiles rather than the complete image. The surrounding tiles are blended using bilinear interpolation to remove the false boundaries. This algorithm can be used to improve image contrast.

Thresholding is a technique in OpenCV, which is the assignment of pixel values in relation to the threshold value provided. In thresholding, each pixel value is compared with the threshold value. If the pixel value is smaller than the threshold, it is set to 0, otherwise, it is set to a maximum value (generally 255).
